      <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-8">How to Bypass the 25 MB Email Limit</h1>
      
      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, and most email providers cap attachments at 25 MB. That's a hard limit—exceed it and your email won't send. Video files are often much larger. A 2-minute smartphone video can easily be 100 MB. A screen recording of a meeting might be 200 MB. So how do you send a video by email without hitting the limit? Compress it first.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-10 mb-4">Why 25 MB?</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        Email wasn't designed for large files. Servers store every attachment, and large attachments multiply storage costs and slow down delivery. Twenty-five megabytes is a compromise: enough for documents and small media, but not enough to turn email into a file transfer service. For larger files, providers expect you to use cloud links (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.). But sometimes you want a direct attachment—no links, no sign-in required. Compression is the answer.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-10 mb-4">Setting the Right Target</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        Aim for 20–24 MB to stay safely under the limit. Email systems vary, and some add overhead. Media Shrinker lets you set a custom target—choose 24 MB and you'll get a file that fits. For a 5-minute video, 24 MB means roughly 640 kbps for video plus audio—acceptable for most purposes. For a 10-minute video, you'll need to compress more aggressively—lower resolution or bitrate—or accept that you might need to split into multiple emails or use a cloud link.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-10 mb-4">Quality vs. Length</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        The math is simple: file size = bitrate × duration. More minutes means less bitrate per minute. A 1-minute video at 24 MB can look great. A 15-minute video at 24 MB will look compressed. If quality matters, consider shortening the clip or splitting it. A 5-minute highlight reel often works better than a 15-minute full recording that looks pixelated.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-10 mb-4">Alternatives When Compression Isn't Enough</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        If your video is too long to compress to 25 MB without unacceptable quality loss, use cloud storage. Upload to Google Drive, set sharing to "anyone with link," and send the link in your email. The recipient gets the full-quality file without attachment limits. For most cases, though, compression to 24 MB is enough—and it keeps everything in one email, no extra steps.
