      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        Video Shrinker was founded by video editors and developers who were tired of hitting file size limits. We'd record a screen share for work, a family moment on our phones, or a tutorial for a project—only to discover that Discord, Gmail, or WhatsApp wouldn't accept the file. "Compress it first," they said. But that meant uploading our private videos to some random website we'd never heard of.
      </p>
      
      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        We didn't want to send our videos to the cloud. We didn't want to install bloated desktop software. We wanted something simple: drag a file in, set a target size, get a smaller file back. And we wanted it to happen entirely on our own devices.
      </p>
      
      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        So we built Video Shrinker. It runs in your browser using WebAssembly—the same technology that powers high-performance web apps—and processes your video locally. Nothing gets uploaded. Nothing gets stored on our servers. Your files never leave your device. We never see them, and we never could.
      </p>
      
      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        Our mission is to make video compression accessible, private, and free. Whether you're a creator sharing clips, a professional sending work files, or someone who just wants to text a video to a friend, Video Shrinker is here to help—without compromising your privacy.
      </p>
      
      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
        Thank you for trusting us with your videos. We take that trust seriously.
      </p>
