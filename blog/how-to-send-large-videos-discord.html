      <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-8">How to Send Large Videos on Discord Without Nitro</h1>
      
      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        Discord has become the go-to platform for gamers, communities, and remote teams. But if you've ever tried to share a video clip, screen recording, or gameplay highlight, you've likely run into a frustrating limit: free accounts can only upload files up to 8 MB. For video, that's barely enough for a few seconds of compressed footage. Nitro subscribers get 500 MB, but not everyone wants to pay. Here's how to compress your videos to fit Discord's free limit—without sacrificing too much quality.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-10 mb-4">Understanding Discord's 8 MB Limit</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        Eight megabytes might sound like a lot, but video files are notoriously large. A single minute of 1080p video at 30 fps can easily be 50–100 MB depending on the codec and bitrate. To fit 8 MB, you need to compress aggressively. That typically means reducing resolution (e.g., 720p or 480p), lowering the bitrate, or shortening the clip. The good news: for Discord's chat context, you usually don't need cinema-quality. A compressed clip that's readable and watchable is often enough.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-10 mb-4">Choosing the Right Target Size</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        Aim for slightly under 8 MB to leave room for encoding variance. Media Shrinker lets you set a target of 8 MB—it will compress to stay under that limit. For a 30-second clip, 8 MB gives you roughly 2 Mbps of video bitrate, which is decent for 720p. For a 60-second clip, you'll need to go lower—around 1 Mbps—which might mean 480p or accepting some quality loss. The key is to match the target size to the content. A screen recording of a tutorial can tolerate more compression than a gameplay clip with fast motion.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-10 mb-4">Step-by-Step: Compress for Discord</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        Open Media Shrinker, drag your video in, and set the target size to 8 MB. If your video is long, consider trimming it first—Discord doesn't need a 10-minute clip when 30 seconds will do. Use the quality slider to preview: if it looks too blocky, shorten the clip or reduce the resolution. Once you're happy, compress and download. The output will be an MP4 that Discord accepts. Upload it to your channel or DM, and you're done.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-10 mb-4">When Nitro Might Be Worth It</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        If you're regularly sharing high-quality video content—stream highlights, edited videos, or tutorials—Nitro's 500 MB limit can save time. But for quick clips, memes, and casual sharing, compression is free and usually sufficient. Media Shrinker runs entirely in your browser, so there's no upload wait—your files stay on your device, and you get a Discord-ready file in minutes.
